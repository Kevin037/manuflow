# Automatic Transaction Number Generation Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented automatic transaction number generation for all models with 'no' columns following the format: **UPPERCASE(3 first alphabet model + '/' + id + date)**

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration Changes
- Created migration `2025_10_07_232032_alter_no_columns_to_nullable.php`
- Made 'no' columns nullable in:
  - `formulas` table
  - `productions` table 
  - `purchase_orders` table
  - `orders` table
- `payments` and `invoices` tables were already nullable

### 2. Model Implementations with Auto Number Generation

#### Formula Model (`FOR/id+date`)
- Added `boot()` method with `created` event
- Format: `FOR/123081025` (FOR + ID + ddmmyy)

#### PurchaseOrder Model (`PUR/id+date`)
- Updated existing `generateTransactionNumber()` method
- Format: `PUR/456081025` (PUR + ID + ddmmyy)

#### Order Model (`ORD/id+date`)
- Fully implemented model with relationships
- Format: `ORD/789081025` (ORD + ID + ddmmyy)

#### Production Model (`PRO/id+date`)
- Fully implemented model with relationships
- Format: `PRO/101081025` (PRO + ID + ddmmyy)

#### Invoice Model (`INV/id+date`)
- Fully implemented model with relationships
- Format: `INV/111081025` (INV + ID + ddmmyy)

#### Payment Model (`PAY/id+date`)
- Fully implemented model with relationships
- Format: `PAY/121081025` (PAY + ID + ddmmyy)

### 3. Additional Model Implementations
- Created complete `OrderDetail` model for order line items
- All models include proper relationships, scopes, and accessors
- Implemented Rupiah currency formatting where applicable

### 4. Dependencies Added
- Installed Select2 package as requested in context

## How It Works

1. **Data Creation**: When a new record is created, the 'no' field starts as NULL
2. **Automatic Generation**: After successful database insertion, the `created` event fires
3. **Number Assignment**: The model generates the transaction number using format: `PREFIX/ID+DDMMYY`
4. **Database Update**: The record is updated with the generated number

## Example Transaction Numbers

```
Formula: FOR/1081025 (Formula ID 1, created on 08/10/25)
Purchase Order: PUR/5081025 (PO ID 5, created on 08/10/25) 
Order: ORD/12081025 (Order ID 12, created on 08/10/25)
Production: PRO/3081025 (Production ID 3, created on 08/10/25)
Invoice: INV/8081025 (Invoice ID 8, created on 08/10/25)
Payment: PAY/15081025 (Payment ID 15, created on 08/10/25)
```

## Testing

- Migration executed successfully
- Models implement proper automatic number generation
- Purchase Order creation form working with auto-generation
- All relationships properly defined

## Next Steps

The automatic transaction number generation is now fully implemented and ready for use. All new records will automatically receive properly formatted transaction numbers after successful creation.
